## ✅ General Tips  
- **Solve Problems Daily**: Start with easy, progress to medium.  
- Use **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, or **GeeksforGeeks**.  
- **Review & Revise** tricky concepts regularly.  
- **Break down hard topics**; take your time if necessary.  

🔥 **Consistency is key! You got this!** 🚀
