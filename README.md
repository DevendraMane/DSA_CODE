- 🔍 Solve basic problem sets: Searching an element, spiral matrix  

4️⃣ **Bit Manipulation**:  
- ⚡ Concepts: AND, OR, XOR, bit shifts  
- 🤔 Problems: Count set bits, power of 2, unique number (XOR-based)  

---

### 🔹 Week 4-5: Recursion & Divide-and-Conquer  
5️⃣ **Recursion**:  
- 🔄 Build intuition for base & recursive cases  
- 📝 Problems: Factorial, Fibonacci, subsets, string permutations  

6️⃣ **Divide and Conquer**:

1️⃣2️⃣ **Binary Search Trees (BST)**:  
- 🔍 Understand properties and solve search-related problems  

1️⃣3️⃣ **Heaps**:  
- 📦 Learn heap operations and implement a priority queue  

---

### 🔹 Week 11: Advanced Algorithms  
1️⃣4️⃣ **Graphs (Basics to Advanced)**:  
- 🌐 BFS, DFS, Shortest Path (Dijkstra), Minimum Spanning Tree  

1️⃣5️⃣ **Dynamic Programming**:  
- 🧮 Subset sum, knapsack, Fibonacci, longest common subsequence  

---

## ✅ General Tips  
🎯 **Solve Problems Daily**:  
- 🟢 Start with easy problems (2-3/day) and progress to medium.  
- 📚 Use platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, or **GeeksforGeeks**.  

🔄 **Review and Revise**:  
- 🔁 Keep revisiting tricky concepts (like recursion, DP) regularly.  

⏳ **Break Down Hard Topics**:  
- 🛑 Don’t rush; if a topic feels difficult, take your time to understand it.  

🔥 **You Got This! Consistency is Key!** ✨
